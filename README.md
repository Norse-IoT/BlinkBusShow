# Blink Bus Show

Folder structure:

- `.` - This folder ("BlinkBusShow") is the [show folder](https://manual.xlights.org/xlights/chapters/chapter-two-quick-start-guide/defining-the-show-directory) for xLights
- `./Sequences` - The sequences folder contains the [xLights sequence](https://manual.xlights.org/xlights/chapters/chapter-five-menus/file/settings/sequences) files.

This should work on Mac and Windows, although I've experienced some incompatibilities with Linux.

## Using Git

Git is an awesome way to collaborate with people. It lets you have several people work on a project at the same time without getting in each others way.

If you're not familiar with Git, you may want to consider [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

You'll want to [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop), and you should be able to open it in xLights.

If you want to make any changes, it's recommended to [create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop). 

That way you can develop your changes independently from anyone else.

If you'd rather not use Git, just upload your files to OneDrive, and let Zack know.
