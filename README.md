# Blink Bus Show

Folder structure:
	- `.` - This folder ("BlinkBusShow") is the show folder for xLights
	- `./Sequences` - The sequences folder contains the [xLights sequence](https://manual.xlights.org/xlights/chapters/chapter-five-menus/file/settings/sequences) files.

This should work on Mac and Windows, although I've experienced some incompatibilities with Linux.
